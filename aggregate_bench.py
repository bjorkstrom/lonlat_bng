"""
A wrapper for cargo bench
Its numeric output is parsed and dumped to a csv
Pass an an optional independent variable from the command line
And also any other static keys and values

USAGE: python aggregate_bench.py [independent variable]
Writes to measurements.csv in the cwd by default, pass a different filepath to alter this
any other keyword arguments will be written as a header row and value. Be careful with that.
